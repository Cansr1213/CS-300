What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Answer: The problem being solved for this project was to develop a course planner course. In the project itself we had to implement data struture, File handling, and Sorting Function.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Answer: Approaching the problem of building the course planner in C++ involved understanding what it needed to do first. This meant breaking down tasks like loading data, managing courses, displaying info, and creating an easy-to-use interface. Choosing the right data structure was key, and I went with Hash Tables because they're great for quick data access and organization. Understanding data structures is crucial because they're like tools in a toolbox foHow did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?r programmers. Each structure has its strengths and weaknesses, and knowing which one to use can make a huge difference in how efficient and effective your programs are. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Answer: The way I overcame any roadblocks I encountered was by seeking help when I had issues. I would reach out to any available tutors and utilize all the resources at my disposal, such as online forums, documentation, and peers, to solve any challenges I faced in my assignments and projects. This collaborative approach not only helped me understand the concepts better but also improved my problem-solving skills and ability to work effectively in a team.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Answer: This project has broadened my software design and development approach significantly. It deepened my understanding of data structures like Hash Tables, teaching me to select the right one for great performance. Handling external files improved my data processing skills, and designing a user-friendly interface emphasized efficiency and user satisfaction in program design. Overall, this experience integrated key aspects of software development, highlighting the importance of efficiency and user satisfaction.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Answer: My work on this project has significantly evolved how I write programs, focusing on maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I learned the importance of code organization, naming conventions, and modularization to make programs easier to maintain and collaborate on. Clear and concise code, breaking down tasks into smaller functions with descriptive names, and adhering to coding standards improved readability
